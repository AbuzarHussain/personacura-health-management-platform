# Personacura

Our project, Personacura, is a smart web-based health and appointment management application
designed to create a seamless bridge between patients and doctors through personalization and
convenience. The platform offers two distinct interfaces: one for doctors to efficiently manage
appointments, upload prescriptions, and reference drug side effects, and another for patients to
access their medical history, track prescriptions, and receive guided health recommendations.
What makes Personacura unique is its focus on proactive healthcare management. Instead of leaving
patients to juggle scattered health records and vague online advice, the platform centralizes
everything into a single, secure system. Patients benefit from innovative tools like the Vaccination
Suggestor, which recommends age and gender-based mandatory and optional vaccines, and the
Symptom Checker, which provides preliminary condition predictions and directs users to the most
relevant department or doctor. On the other side, doctors can use structured dashboards to manage
patients, digitize prescriptions, and access detailed references on medications and chemical side
effects for safer care.
Beyond functionality, Personacura solves real world problems. Patients often struggle with
fragmented information, appointments on one app, prescriptions on paper, and medical advice
spread across unreliable sources. Doctors, meanwhile, face inefficiencies in managing patient records
and communication. By creating a unified, user-friendly ecosystem, Personacura keeps patients
engaged in their health journey and equips doctors with the tools to deliver faster, safer, and better
care. Built on real datasets such as symptom disease mappings, vaccination schedules, and drug side
effects, the app
